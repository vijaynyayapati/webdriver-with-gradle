webdriver-with-gradle
=====================

This is a framework I created for webdriver with gradle. The framework is pretty bare bones at the moment.

You can run the sample test with the following command

build functional

The default browser is Chrome, but if you would like to run using Firefox, run the following command

build functional -Dbrowser='Firefox'
